## Leveraging Turborepo for Efficient Development

This project uses Turborepo to manage the monorepo, optimizing development workflows through parallel task execution and caching.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js version 23 and pnpm installed on your machine. These are essential for running the project efficiently.

## Installation Instructions

1. Install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Running the Project:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
   This command concurrently starts both the client and server.

## Getting Started

1. Start the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```
This command utilizes Turborepo to run the `dev` script across all packages concurrently.
